    Given a list of numbers and a target value return the index location of the

    If the target value is not in the list return -1
    If multiple of the target value exist within the list you may return either

    Example list [1,3,5,7,9] target = 3 returned value would be 1 because 3 can be

    Example list [3, 7, 8, 1, 0, 1, 12] target = 1 a return of either 3 or 5 would
    be valid.
    Example list [1,3,5,6,9] target 7 returns -1 because 7 is not within the list.
